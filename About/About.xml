        Caravans can now create road construction sites to build roads between two neighbouring tiles on the world map. By using the "Work" action, caravans provide work and resources to the site until completion.
        
        Costs are based on the type of road to be built &amp; the terrain of both tiles. Roads cost wood, stones, steel &amp; chemfuel.
